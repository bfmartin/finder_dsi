Version 4.0.0 2012-08-01
	- data/dsistrip.json: added strips to 2012-07-31.
	- created a gem called finder_dsi. The version number jumps to a
	major release because of this, and its format changes slightly to
	be compatible with gems. renamed some files to keep in line with
	the new name.
	- imported code into github. some files have been re-arranged to
	better suit their layout.
	- bin/*.rb: renamed program files to be more consistent.
	- README converted to markdown format. Some minor cleanups as well.
	- some refactoring as part of the gem creation. Some APIs have
	changed to be backwards incompatible. Since I don't know of anyone
	who uses these Ruby APIs, it probably doesn't matter much.

	immediate
